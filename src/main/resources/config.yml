# This multiplication is applied to the base value
# ---
# It is calculated by the following:
#   base + (level * multiply)
# ---
# Example: base = 10, sharpness = 5, knockback = 1, multiply = 0.25
# The enchantments are sorted by level in descending order, so the more enchantments you have, the more expensive it is.
#   10 + (1 * 1) = 11
#   15 + (5 * 1.25) = 17.25
#   17.25
# Multiplication value from 0 to infinity (0.25 = 25%) for the cost of the disenchantment
