# Disenchantment
### Get back enchantments from items!

Put enchanted Item into the first slot in anvil, then a book to the second slot and book, you will have a enchanted book ready for you! But careful! It costs experience!! Can be edited in config of how much you will be paying :)

The weapon or the item you are removing the enchantments from is kept!! It does NOT delete itself! :)
