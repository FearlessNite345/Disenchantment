### DO NOT USE ECO ENCHANTS, THERE IS A BUG!!!

Get enchantments back from items in anvils. The plugin supports only ExcellentEnchants and AdvancedEnchantments! Also it enables configuration such as disabled worlds, disabled enchantments, experience cost...

To use the plugin, put your enchanted item in the first slot of an anvil and in the second put an empty book. After this new item will pop up in the result of an anvil with the enchatments from the item you put in. The first slot is not deleted, it is kept either with no enchantments or enchantments that you configured to be disabled in the configuration, more information about this is in the commands.
